# :necktie: Employee Directory Project using OOJS and jQuery

## How to use this repository

* Clone the repository and open the `index.html` file.

This showcase project uses an API (https://randomuser.me) to create a (mock) employee directory of 12 employees for a (mock) company, Awesome Startup. 

The API returns a JSON object, which is parsed. A modal window opens when the employee's name or image is clicked. This modal window displays extra information.

### Source files

The following files were used as a start point for this project.

* `index.html` - basic markup that you'll dynamically add DOM elements to.

* `css/styles.css` - all the basic styles you'll need for this project. But you are encouraged to experiment with things like color, background color, font, shadows, transitions and animations to make this project your own.

* `css/normalize.css` - for cross-browser consistency.

* `mockups/employee_directory.png` and `mockups/employee_overlay.png` - examples of what the finished project should look like.

### Extras
A filter is added to filter search through employee names. Also, when the modal window is open, the user can move forwards or backwards to view other employees depending on the current shown employees.

### Ressources
